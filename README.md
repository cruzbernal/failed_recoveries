Code created by Jen Cruz for: 

Cruz J., Windels S.K., Thogmartin W.E., Crimmins S.M., Grim L.H., Larson J.H., Zuckerberg B. (in review) 
'Top-down effects of repatriating bald eagles hinder jointly recovering competitors'. Nature Ecology & Evolution.

Purpose:
Evaluating the influence of top-down and bottom-up factors on the failed recoveries of osprey and great blue heron populations in 
Voyageurs National Park, Minnesota, USA.

Code includes: 
JAGs code for the (1) osprey and (2) heron models. 
Each JAG script contains priors for variable selection, likelihood calculations for
observed and predicted data, and derived model parameters (summarizing results for the park).
Model fit and evaluation calculations (including COPs, WAIC and Bayesian p values) for the (3) osprey and (4) heron models. 

Detailed model descriptions and formulas for model fit and evaluation approaches are described in detail in the manuscript.
